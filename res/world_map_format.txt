# Each line must follow the form :
# <dungeon_filename> <x> <y> <right_node> <up_node> <left_node> <down_node>
# where :
# <dungeon_filename> : self-explanatory. The '.' name is reserved and indicates that there's
#                      no dungeon.
# <x> <y>            : Position, in image pixels, of this node.
# <<direction>_node> : Number of the node to go to, given a direction. 
#                      Set to 0 when there's no node in that direction.
